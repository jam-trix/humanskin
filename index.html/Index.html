    <p>The skin is the body’s largest organ, made of water, protein, fats and minerals. Your skin protects your body from germs and regulates body temperature. Nerves in the skin help you feel sensations like hot and cold.</p>
    &nbsp;
<p> Did you know that your skin is the largest organ in your body and can weigh up to 20 pounds? It’s not just there to keep your insides in — your skin is constantly defending you from bacteria, regulating your body temperature, and even helping you feel the world through millions of nerve endings. Every minute, you shed about <strong>30,000 to 40,000 dead skin cells</strong> — that’s nearly <strong>9 pounds of skin </strong> a year! And here’s the kicker: your skin completely renews itself about every 27 days. It’s like wearing a brand-new suit every month without even knowing it!</p>
	&nbsp;
<p>But that’s not all — your skin is also a communication tool. Ever felt goosebumps when you're cold or scared? That’s your skin reacting to emotions and temperature, a survival trait we inherited from our furry ancestors. It also changes color to protect you from the sun; melanin in your skin increases with sun exposure, giving you a tan — which is actually your body’s way of shielding DNA from UV damage.<p/>
	&nbsp;
<p>Beneath the surface, your skin is layered like a high-tech defense system. The <strong>epidermis</strong> (outer layer) acts as a waterproof barrier and is the first line of defense. The <strong>dermis</strong> (middle layer) is packed with blood vessels, sweat glands, and nerves, helping regulate temperature and sensations. And finally, the <strong>hypodermis</strong> (inner layer), or subcutaneous layer, stores fat for insulation and energy. All three layers work in perfect harmony to protect, sense, and support your body every second of the day.</p>
	&nbsp;
    <p>Taking care of your skin is essential—stay hydrated, use sunscreen, and keep your skin clean and moisturized!</p>
